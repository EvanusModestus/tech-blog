== Introduction

After managing traditional perimeter-based security for years, the shift to Zero Trust fundamentally changed how we approach network security. ISE became our Policy Decision Point (PDP) in a comprehensive Zero Trust architecture.

== Why Zero Trust Matters Now

[quote, Personal Experience]
____
The 2020 remote work explosion broke our perimeter model overnight. We had to rebuild security from the ground up, assuming breach and verifying everything.
____

Traditional perimeter security failed when:

* Users worked from anywhere
* Applications moved to cloud
* IoT devices proliferated
* Lateral movement post-breach became common

== TODO: Implementation Details

[TODO]
====
* [ ] Add pxGrid integration examples
* [ ] Include Rapid Threat Containment workflows  
* [ ] Document API integrations with SOAR
* [ ] Add performance metrics from production
====

== TODO: Microsegmentation Strategy

[OUTLINE]
====
1. TrustSec implementation
2. Dynamic VLAN assignment
3. SGT design patterns
4. East-West traffic inspection
====

== Lessons Learned (In Progress)

* Initial deployment issues with certificate management
* Scale challenges with context sharing
* Integration pain points with third-party systems

[NOTE]
====
Need to add specific examples from the 2023 deployment
